### Data Preparation

```{r setup, echo=TRUE, results='hide', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# load data

library(tidyverse)
library(openintro)

s_belts <- data.frame(Seatbelts)
s_belts

```


### Research question 

**You should phrase your research question in a way that matches up with the scope of inference your dataset allows for.**

Do seat belt laws predict a reduction in road casualties?

### Cases 

**What are the cases, and how many are there?**

Great Britain driver deaths/seriously injured, front seat passenger deaths/seriously injured, rear-seat passenger deaths/seriously injured.

### Data collection 

**Describe the method of data collection.**

The data was collected in 1989 by A.C. Harvey, and in 2001 by J. Durbin and S. J. Koopman.

### Type of study 

**What type of study is this (observational/experiment)?**

This is an experimental study.  We would like to see the effect of seat belt laws on rider deaths.

### Data Source 

**If you collected the data, state self-collected. If not, provide a citation/link.**

### Dependent Variable

**What is the response variable? Is it quantitative or qualitative?**

There are 4 possible response variables in this study, namely the types of casualties/serious injuries between driver/front seat passengers/back seat passengers/van drivers.  These are all quantitative variables.

### Independent Variable

**You should have two independent variables, one quantitative and one qualitative.**

One independent variable is the status of the seat belt law, whether it was in effect or not.  This is a qualitative variable expressed as a Boolean True/False value.

Another independent variable could be the distance driven in km.  This could affect whether people wear seat belts or not.  This is a quantitative value.

### Relevant summary statistics 

**Provide summary statistics for each the variables. Also include appropriate visualizations related to your research question (e.g. scatter plot, boxplots, etc). This step requires the use of R, hence a code chunk is provided below. Insert more code chunks as needed.**

```{r}

ggplot(s_belts, aes(x = DriversKilled)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 40)
ggplot(s_belts, aes(x = drivers)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 40)
ggplot(s_belts, aes(x = front)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 40)
ggplot(s_belts, aes(x = rear)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 40)

```
